Here's an explanation of how to create the `/includes/Config.php` file that you've mentioned. This file seems to contain configuration settings for your plugin, and you've indicated that it should be in the `.gitignore` list, which is a good practice to avoid accidentally sharing sensitive information.

1. **Create the File:** In your plugin's root directory, create a new folder called `/includes/` if it doesn't already exist. Inside this folder, create a new file named `Config.php`.

2. **Copy Your Configuration Code:** Copy the entire content of your configuration file that you've provided into the newly created `Config.php` file.

3. **Add Placeholder Values:** In your code, there are places where sensitive information like API credentials are being used. To avoid exposing these credentials in your codebase, you can use placeholders. For example:

   ```php
   public static function get_identity_client()
   {
       return 'YOUR_IDENTITY_CLIENT_PLACEHOLDER';
   }
   
   public static function get_identity_secret()
   {
       return 'YOUR_IDENTITY_SECRET_PLACEHOLDER';
   }

   // ... other methods with placeholders ...
   ```

   Replace `'YOUR_IDENTITY_CLIENT_PLACEHOLDER'` and `'YOUR_IDENTITY_SECRET_PLACEHOLDER'` with appropriate placeholders that you'll replace with actual values at runtime.

4. **Store Sensitive Information Securely:** Instead of hardcoding sensitive information in your `Config.php` file, you should store them securely, such as using environment variables or a configuration file outside the web root.

5. **Usage:** In your main plugin file (e.g., `your-plugin.php`), you can include the `Config.php` file to use the configuration settings. Here's how you can include the file:

   ```php
   require_once plugin_dir_path(__FILE__) . 'includes/Config.php';
   ```

6. **Add to `.gitignore`:** Open your `.gitignore` file located in your plugin's root directory. Add a line to ignore the `Config.php` file, so it won't be committed to your version control system:

   ```
   /includes/Config.php
   ```

By following these steps, you can create the `/includes/Config.php` file for your plugin's configuration while keeping sensitive information secure and excluding it from version control. Remember to replace placeholder values with actual credentials and sensitive information using secure methods at runtime.
